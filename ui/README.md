# ui

Package ui provides a work-in-progress model for taking user input.
Everything graphical is up to the user to deal with based on the layout
structure.

## Examples

[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) is required to run the examples.

Installing and running the examples is simple, assuming you have your
$GOPATH/bin setup in $PATH:

```
$ go get j4k.co/exp/ui/examples/...
$ ui-wip
```
